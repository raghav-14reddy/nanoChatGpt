<human> 31 Hi. Is it possible for me to have the ayurvedic therapy.? I went for a metal implant surgery for my hip and leg about 8 months ago. Pls advice. Are there any special therapy?<endOfText>
<bot>Metal implants are generally of non-corossive inert material which withstand normal stress of day to day activity for a considerable period of time. Since the implant was about eight months ago they should have adapted well to your body. Therefore there is no harm whatsoever in trying out Ayurvedic therapy if you are having allied problems of the surgical venture like aches, pains, numbness etc. Ayurvedic threapy can be planned for you after we have had the occassion to personally examine you.<endOfText>
<human> 32 Hi, we have been trying for a child since 2011. I had a miscarriage in May 2012, at 17 weeks due to a cord accident and another miscarriage in April 2013 at 8 weeks ( no growth/ heartbeat). Do you have any treatment to help me conceive and have a successful pregnancy?<endOfText>
<bot>From your mail, it becomes clear that you have conceived at least two times in the past. This means that the problem is not as much in your ability to conceive as it is in the ability of your uterus to sustain gestation till full growth of the foetus and eventual delivery. In Ayurveda there are a number of approaches we can try so that the growing foetus remains intrauterine till it has reached full maturity as also to enable its normal growth. We would therefor advice you to kindly make it convenient to visit us at our clinic with all available previous medical records so that we can sit together and plan out a suitable treatment schedule for you.<endOfText>

Yes, going for radiotherapy is not a very pleasurable experience. In Ayurveda, there are some medicines which can be taken to minimize collateral damage ti healthy cells by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Studies are going on in different parts, especially in India and elsewhere on Ayurvedic medicines as adjuvants and buffers in radiotherapy. It is advisable for you to continue radiotherapy. You may however be benefitted by taking Ayurvedic drugs along with it to protect healthy cells and to safeguard them.<endOfText>

We therefore request you not to worry too much regarding your problem because help is available.

<human> 73 My mum is diagnosed as having nasal polyps in her left nose n now both nostrils are blocked n she having difficulties in breathing. Operation will take few mths to do. In the meantime any help with ayurvedic<endOfText>

However since it would essentially be an elective surgery it would be worthwhile considering alternative medicinal options. There are a few Ayurvedic remedies that can be definitely tried for your mother.<endOfText>
<human>I had a life saving surgery two years ago. Some parts of my small and big intestines were removed. This has caused my small intestinal ability to absorb nutrients and big intestinal ability to absorb water from stools greatly reduced. I cannot take food immediately after water or vice versa because it gives me watery stools. My normal weight 58-60kg but now 45-46kg. Also due to reduced intake of water my skin is dry and flakey.<endOfText>
<bot>some portions of your intestines have been removed. As you are aware, primates have a much lengthier intestine as compared to carnivorous animals like a lion for instance. This is so to enable proper digestion of fibre. Fibre is an essential ingredient or rather should be an essential ingredient in our diet and it is to enable proper digestion and assimilation of it that we have a long intestine. Since you have had some portions of it surgically removed, a structural change has been made in your digestive system. Whereas some of your problems can be managed by medicines, some of the symptoms directly attributable to the changed structural dimension of your alimentary canal may persist in some form or the other. However, we do feel we can address your symptoms of watery stools, weight loss etc. to your satisfaction.<endOfText>

<human>I have frozen shoulder problem and looking for therapy for the same. I have thyroid problem as well.<endOfText>
<bot>rozen shoulder is an extremely distressing condition since it hinders effective movements of the affected shoulder. It starts off mostly as a painful restriction of movements which progresses to end up in frozen movements of the shoulder causing great deal of embarrassment. Often it is associated with diabetes to the extent that physicians would first want to rule out diabetic peri-arthritis before embarking upon a treatment schedule. In your case you have also mentioned thyroid problems. We would therefore like to run you through some diagnostic modalities before recommending proper medicines and procedures. We would like to have a look at your X-ray, MRI scan ,Blood investigation report, Urine investigation report among other things to be able to schedule proper treatment measures. <endOfText>
<human>      My both hands last 2 fingers feel numbness and as well my shoulder pain. As I had done my MRI and found my spine C5, 6 and 7 shown the narrowing of the bones that settled on the nerves. May I know any help? Thanks and I appreciate your advise.<endOfText>
<bot>Your symptoms seem to be related to cervical spondylosis and resultant mild, moderate or grave injury to the nerves that exit from this part of the spine and supply the upper limbs. You may be aware that the main nerves that supply most of the upper limb areas are the ulnar, radial and medial nerves. We believe part of any of these could have been affected causing you the distressing symptoms mentioned by you. Ayurvedic medicines for internal as well as external use are available to deal with it<endOfText>
<human>I got redness in my face and skin doctor is saying rosacea When go outside and come back getting face severe face allergy do not know is this because of sun or food can you guide me is there any treatment for this.<endOfText>
<bot>It seems you are having some kind of photosensitivity or allergic dermatitis of some kind. There are of course excellent remedies available in Ayurveda to address your problem. You will appreciate that to identify the type of skin allergy that you are having we would like to personally examine the skin manifestation. Further treatment can be decided upon after inspection.<endOfText>
<human> 34 Hi,my 7 yrs old son was diagnosed wt asthma. Pls advice the food type that cn trigger the asthma attack. Regular exercise like running around school field cn trigger asthma attack? Please advice<endOfText>
<bot>Asthma, as you have rightly surmised can be triggered by food. Of course, there are a number of things on which allergy tests are available in the market. But asthma can also be triggered by things not in the list. The best way to identify what triggers the attack in your son is to watch carefully and draw logical conclusions. Perhaps dust, pollen, smoke, suspended particles or even humidity in the air can cause asthmatic attack when your son is running around at school. In ayurveda, rather than worry about the trigger we focus more on enhancing ones defenses or immunity. Thus even when one is surrounded by all kinds of dust and pollen your immune system being strong does not exhibit a panic exaggerated reaction as seen in asthma<endOfText>

<human> 27 I would like to try ayurveda but I don't know where to start  I do have bad skin and creaking of joints  but I like to try ayurveda for overall well-being instead of just my problem areas .<endOfText>

<human>Dear Physician, I am enquiring on behalf of my father. He is suffering from diabetes which has now affected his right eye vision and caused numbness in his legs. May I know what kind of treatment do you have for his diabetes conditions. Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Diabetes is an illness that has wide ramifications in the manner in which its effects are felt in various systems of the body. The symptoms you were referring to most probably are indications of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. The treatment modalities to be adopted in such cases would have to look into the end-organs affected ( in your father's case, the eye and the nerves) as also the broader, wider aspect of increased circulating blood glucose which ideally aught to be inside the cells of the various systems. In Ayurveda we have effective treatment for diabetes and its complications. We expect these measures to be beneficial in providing relief in the conditions mentioned by you.<endOfText>
<human> 32 Do you have treatment that helps with infertility problems like PCOS and recurring miscarriages? I have had 3 miscarriages due to my diabetes problem and my first pregnancy was only after 2 years of marriage. Now in my 4th year of marriage and just had another miscarriage in March this year. <endOfText>
<bot>PCOS as well as miscarriage are in some way related to the broader picture of diabetes you mentioned as having. In Ayurveda we do have safe and effective measures to manage these conditions. Our treatment would be essentially three-pronged viz. addressing the elevated blood glucose, managing PCOS and ensuring that the fertilized ovum next time around stays in your uterus till full term and delivery. <endOfText>
<human>   Hello I was wondering if you provide consultation for people who wish to complement their meds with ayurvedic herbs? and to monitor them as well<endOfText>

<human> I want to build my body to gain some weight. For this purpose I have started to got to gym but no gain I still look think. Can you suggest what can I do to build body and gain weight? Also want to know are the supplements available in market (Whey protein and others) are good to take or not?<endOfText>
<bot>Ayurveda considers slimness to be at all times better than stoutness. Even though this has been the stated position of Ayurveda expounded at least five thousand years ago, the modern world has only of late appreciated this in the light of mounting evidences of the predisposition of stoutness to all kinds of ailments. The rising incidence of life style diseases has once again stressed this fact. Having said that, it is presumed that you may want to increase your weight as you may be a little under-weight and lean in which case, let us assure you that there are many effective and safe measures in ayurveda to enhance body-weight which can be tried for you. Regarding supplements, ad they are over-the-counter products your discretion is advised if you choose to try any of those.<endOfText>
<human> This will be my first time trying Ayurvedic. I am experiencing localised heavy feeling on top of my head just above my forehead. I suffer from tinnitus over a year and feel moving pressure in my head a lot of time. I have been to doctors and am declared normal. I hope to check out your massage therapies to ease my stress.<endOfText>
<bot>Ayurvedic massages are refreshing, enjoyable and therapeutic. From your mail it is clear that your symptoms of heaviness, tinnitus etc. do not have a clear somatic basis and is more or less an expression of some underlying stress. Ayurvedic massages, as you may already be aware, go a long way in relieving stress. <endOfText>
<human>I am having intense pain in upper back (shoulder blade) whenever i turn my head towards left side and also when i lift using my left hand. Could you suggest what should I do to get rid of this pain?<endOfText>
<bot>like to have more inputs like the nature of your job, the height of pillows, whether you have to travel a lot and if so, the mode of transport etc. These things have to be asked because you are just 29 years of age so degenerative changes to the extent found in classical spondylosis cannot be expected. A personal physical examination would be in order to diagnose the cause of your pain.<endOfText>
<human>I would like a basic examination to see where my imbalances are. Also, I am having back problems (potentially just muscular) and would like to learn how to treat them and prevent future issues.<endOfText>
<bot>n Ayurveda there are three basic body types viz. vatika, paittika and kaphaja. And then there are various combinations of these three body-types. It is possible to group all people into these body-types. <endOfText>
<human>Hi I have Tourette sydrome since young. Have you ever treated anyone with this? I can't seem to find any help with western medication.<endOfText>
<bot>Tourette syndrome (TS), as you know, is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations (tics). The disorder is named after Dr. Georges Gilles de la Tourette, the pioneering French neurologist who in 1885 first described the condition.<endOfText>

Can u help me to guide is their and curable medicine at ur side or any other general advice.<endOfText>
<bot>Lichen planus is essentially a kind of autoimmune disease with skin manifestations. Autoimmune diseases, as you may be aware, is a group of diseases for which modern medicine has no cure to offer. Alternative systems like ayurveda can definitely offer clinical relief including substantial reduction in area of lesion and the associated symptoms they exhibit. However in such cases treatment would have to be continued for a long period of time for satisfactory results.<endOfText>

<human>51 My doctor has diagnosis that I am suffering from motor neuron disease. Currently my leg strength has weaken and I am limping and my speech is also affected. Will ayurvedic help my condition.<endOfText>
<bot>Motor neurone diseases fall under a category where unfortunately science is still only trying to understand its complexities and trying to device means of effective management. As of now there is no sure fire treatment modality. However clinical relief with respect to your symptoms may be attempted with ayurvedic medicines. We believe ayurvedic medicines can help provide some relief to your symptoms of muscle weakness, speech problems etc.<endOfText>

Currently im having severe neck pain and stiffness  Both Shoulder pain and numbness over both upper limbs  Lower back pain radiating till sacral  Kindly advice me the treatment that i should seek<endOfText>
<bot>ou are having pain, stiffness etc of the neck as well as low back region.

<human>Hi, Recently i was involved in an accident and broke my right collarbone(clavicle fracture). I saw the doctor and was told that surgery may not be necessary if the bone knot its six weeks now but there is no reduction(haven gone for 2nd review) in the bone it still sticks out slightly do u have any experience to make the broken collar bone same as the other one. I am a student<endOfText>
<bot>Collar bones readily heal. They do not even require a proper anatomical apposition to heal. In your case we believe that the bone has already healed or is healing. Regarding the projection, it is because proper reduction was not done. But if there is no obvious cosmetic urgent reasons we advice you to forget about it. It is not going to cause much restriction in movements etc. However, if you feel you are not satisfied with it you can apply some ayurvedic medicines externally and wait to see the result. If you are still not satisfied you may have to get a surgical repair done. For the time being we would advice you to try out our medicines for a sufficient enough time and then take a call.<endOfText>

I could not find the best therapy for me, in the list mentioned in the website. Kindly guide me about the therapy I need to undergo.<endOfText>
<bot>A dislocated shoulder is a very painful and frustrating problem, especially for a woman like you. It could also be an embarrassment and often saps your self confidence. The problem with shoulder dislocation is also the fact that there is a high risk of recurrence if proper care and caution is not taken<endOfText>

Generally burping occurs when food is hastily ingested. Also some kind of food cause 'gas' in the stomach. <endOfText>

I am still having headache near eyebrows and feel congested in the right nose. I do not want to continue with the heavy doses of allopathy medicines. Please suggest if anything can be done with your therapies. Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Sinusitis is indeed a distressing condition. However it is widely accepted that the role of antibiotics is valid only in certain instances of high bacterial infections. Therefore prudence and care in antibiotic therapy is advised. Sinusitis is often seen to be readilly amenable to Ayuredic treatment when properly done. <endOfText>

Vascular headaches, tension headaches are also very common. <endOfText>
